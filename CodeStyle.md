    Beautiful is better than ugly. 
    Explicit is better than implicit. 
    Simple is better than complex. 
    Complex is better than complicated. 
    Flat is better than nested. 
    Sparse is better than dense. 
    Readability counts. 
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. 
    Although practicality beats purity. 
    Errors should never pass silently. 
    Unless explicitly silenced. 
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. 
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. 
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. 
    Now is better than never. 
    Although never is often better than *right* now. 
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. 
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. 
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! 

## 缩进
    用4个空格来缩进代码
## 分号 
    不要在行尾加分号, 也不要用分号将两条命令放在同一行。
## 行长度
    每行不超过80个字符
    如果一个文本字符串在一行放不下, 可以使用圆括号来实现隐式行连接
    以下情况除外：
      1.长的导入模块语句
      2.注释里的URL 
## 空行
    要将程序的不同部分分开，可使用空行。
## 括号
    宁缺毋滥的使用括号
    除非是用于实现行连接, 否则不要在返回语句或条件语句中使用括号. 不过在元组两边使用括号是可以的 
## 注释
    确保对模块, 函数, 方法和行内注释使用正确的风格
